Create a simple Nginx web server image and run it in a container on your local Docker host, and optionally push it to a Docker registry.

Here's a step-by-step workflow:

1. Install Docker:
Install Docker on your Ubuntu system. You can use the following commands in the terminal:
bash

ðŸ”¹sudo apt update
ðŸ”¸sudo apt install -y docker.io
ðŸ”¹sudo systemctl enable --now docker

Verify that Docker is installed and running by ðŸ”¸running docker --version.


2. Create a Dockerfile:
Create a directory for your Docker project, and inside it, create a file named Dockerfile (with no file extension).

Add the following content to your Dockerfile to create an Nginx image:
Dockerfile

ðŸ”¸FROM nginx:latest
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/

Create an index.html file in the same directory if it doesn't already exist.


3. Build the Docker Image:
In the same directory as your Dockerfile, run the following command to build the Docker image:
bash

ðŸ”¹docker build -t my-nginx-image .

This command builds an image named "my-nginx-image" using the current directory as the build context.


4. Run a Docker Container:
Run a container from your image with the following command:
bash

ðŸ”¸docker run -d -p 80:80 my-nginx-image

This command starts a detached (-d) container and maps port 80 of your host to port 80 of the container.


5. Access Nginx:
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost or your server's IP address to see the Nginx default page.


6. Docker Registry (optional):
If you want to share your image with others or deploy it on another system, you can push it to a Docker registry like Docker Hub. First, you need to create a Docker Hub account and log in using docker login.

Tag your image with your Docker Hub username and repository name:
bash

ðŸ”¸docker tag my-nginx-image your-dockerhub-username/my-nginx-image


7. Push the image to Docker Hub:
bash

ðŸ”¹docker push your-dockerhub-username/my-nginx-image


You can then pull and run this image on other systems using the docker run command.


This workflow outlines the process of creating a Docker image with an Nginx web server, running it as a container, and optionally pushing it to a Docker registry for distribution. It can serve as a foundation for more complex Docker projects.
